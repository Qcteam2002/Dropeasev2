## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

### Why 4 Tiers?
- **Free**: Low friction trial
- **Starter**: First upgrade trigger (quantity)
- **Pro**: Main revenue driver (AI insights)
- **Business**: High-value customer capture (bulk operations)

### Why Highlight Pro?
- Optimal price point ($19.9)
- Best value-to-price ratio
- Target 60%+ adoption
- Maximizes ARPU

### Why Gate AI Segmentation?
- Create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- Preview in Starter creates curiosity
- Full unlock in Pro creates upgrade motivation
- Core differentiator vs competitors

### Why Bulk Optimization in Business Only?
- Justifies $49.9 price point
- Targets scale-focused customers
- Solves specific pain point
- Creates clear upgrade path from Pro

---

## 🔄 Upgrade Funnel Logic

### Free → Starter ($0 → $9)
**Trigger**: Hit product/generation limits  
**Solution**: 5x increase for only $9/mo  
**Target Rate**: 30% within 7 days

### Starter → Pro ($9 → $19.9)
**Trigger**: See segment preview, can't use it  
**Solution**: Full AI Segmentation unlock  
**Target Rate**: 40% within 30 days ⭐ **KEY METRIC**

### Pro → Business ($19.9 → $49.9)
**Trigger**: Manual optimization too slow  
**Solution**: Bulk operations + unlimited usage  
**Target Rate**: 10% within 90 days
